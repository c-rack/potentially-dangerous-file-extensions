# potentially-dangerous-file-extensions
Lists of potentially dangerous file extensions you might not want to download or as e-mail attachments

## Available formats

* [Text file with one EXT per line](extenstions.txt)
* [Text file with one .EXT per line](extensions-with-dot.txt)
* [JSON array with EXT](extensions.json)
* [JSON array with .EXT](extensions-with-dot.json)

## Contributing

If you want to add an extension, edit `generate.sh` and then just run the script.
Pull requests are welcome and I try to merge them quickly.
